Description: PIPET can be used to predict relevant subpopulations in single-cell data from phenotypic information in 
    bulk data. You can use known feature vectors of phenotypic information or create feature vectors via the function 
    in the PIPET. This package also provides commonly used downstream analysis for creating customizable visualization 
    results.
